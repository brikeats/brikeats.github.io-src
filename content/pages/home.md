I'm a computer vision engineer who has worked professionally analyzing medical, satellite, and microscopy imagery. Currently, I lead the Computer Vision group as part of [Uptake's](www.uptake.com) data science team. Previously, I worked at the University of Chicago's [Research Computing Center](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/), and at the Univerty of Hawaii's [MRI research group](http://hawaii.edu/mri/home_v6.htm). You can see my [resume here]({filename}/pdfs/keating_resume.pdf) and a full (slightly out of date) academic [cirriculum vitae here]({filename}/pdfs/keating_cv.pdf).

The remarkable success of deep learning in computer vision has led me to use  convolutional neural nets more often as the backbone of much of my work analyzing satellite imagery. Reading up on the literature for deep learning, it's hard not to be excited about the possibilities for AI in the coming years. I'm particularly interested in computer vision, especially in embodied systems, i.e., robots.  [My blog](blog.html) will serve as an online notebook for demos, documentation, links, etc., related to personal projects, especially in robotics.
