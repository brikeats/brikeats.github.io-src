I'm a computer vision engineer who has worked professionally analyzing medical, satellite, and microscopy imagery. Currently, I work as Senior Scientist, MLOps Lead at [Cortechs.ai](https://cortechs.ai/) where I train neural networks and write apps for medical image segmentation. I've previously worked in computer vision/image analysis roles at [Uptake](https://www.uptake.com), at the University of Chicago's [Research Computing Center](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/), and at the Univerty of Hawaii's [MRI research group](https://mri.jabsom.hawaii.edu/). You can see my [resume here]({static}/pdfs/keating_resume.pdf) and a full (dated) academic [cirriculum vitae here]({static}/pdfs/keating_cv.pdf). I occasionally post on CV- or robotics-related personal projects on [my blog](blog.html).
