I'm a computer vision engineer who has worked professionally analyzing medical, satellite, and microscopy imagery. Currently, I lead the Computer Vision group as part of [Uptake's](www.uptake.com) data science team. Previously, I worked at the University of Chicago's [Research Computing Center](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/), and at the Univerty of Hawaii's [MRI research group](http://hawaii.edu/mri/home_v6.htm). You can see my [resume here]({filename}/pdfs/old_resume.pdf) and an full (slightly stale) academic [cirriculum vitae here]({filename}/pdfs/old_cv.pdf).

The remarkable success of deep learning in computer vision has led me to increasingly reach to convolutional neural nets as the backbone of much of my work analyzing satellite imagery. Reading up on the literature for deep learning, it is hard not become excited about in the possibilities of AI in the coming years. I'm particularly interested in computer vision especially in embodied systems, i.e., robots.  [My blog](blog.html) will serve as a clearinghouse for demos, documentation, links, and notes related to personal projects, particularly in robotics.
