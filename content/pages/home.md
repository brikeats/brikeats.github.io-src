I'm a computer vision engineer who has worked professionally analyzing medical, satellite, and microscopy imagery. Currently, I work as an AI & Machine Learning Engineer at [Healthlytix](https://www.healthlytix.com/), an early-stage precision health startup. I've previously worked in computer vision/image analysis roles at [Uptake](www.uptake.com), at the University of Chicago's [Research Computing Center](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/), and at the Univerty of Hawaii's [MRI research group](http://hawaii.edu/mri/home_v6.htm). You can see my [resume here]({filename}/pdfs/keating_resume.pdf) and a full academic [cirriculum vitae here]({filename}/pdfs/keating_cv.pdf).

The remarkable success of deep learning in computer vision has led me to use  convolutional neural nets as the backbone of much of my work analyzing medical imagery. Reading up on the literature for deep learning, it's hard not to be excited about the possibilities for AI in the coming years. I'm particularly interested in computer vision, especially in embodied systems, i.e., robots.  [My blog](blog.html) will serve as an online notebook for demos, documentation, links, etc., related to personal projects, especially in robotics.
