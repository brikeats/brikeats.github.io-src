[whale's vagina ipa](beer/whalesvaginaipa.html) Served on draft at Healthlytix. Much darker that predicted, very murky-looking. Decent bitterness, still not as much hop smell as I'd like. Hop taste is overwhelmed by caramel flavor, doesn't come across as an IPA.

[hazy ipa with cryo hops](beer/hazyipa.htm) Very good, popular at Healthlytix, one of my best. Hop smell fades after a few weeks, but still has good hop flavor. I'd prefer it a bit sweeter/less attenuated.  

[obligatory pale ale](beer/obligatorypaleale.htm) 7/18. Good, pretty similar to the cryo hazy. It's not very clear, possibly due to dryhop haze (this is only after the first few pints). The fruitiness of the yeast comes through, as does the dankness of the hops. It dried out over time, increasing the perceived bitterness, but it remained drinkable and pretty good. I'll be using this as a base recipe for my pale ales going forward.

[witbier](beer/haolewitbier.htm) 7/18. <s>Terrible.</s> Not great. The fermentation was warm, it dried out more than expected, (FG ~1.004) resulting in higher ABV than I was shooting for. The yeast smell dominated -- it did not smell "banana", nor "clove", just "yeasty". The yeast smell did fade over the course of 4 weeks, allowing the chamomile and orange to come throught a bit. <s>It still has off-flavors and I consider it a failure. I'm still gonna drink it, though.</s> After 6+ weeks in the fridge, it's drinkable. I've had bad luck with belgian yeast, I'm going to be sticking with british yeast from now on.

[hoppy cryo wheat](beer/hoppywheat.htm) 8/18. Basically the same as the [hazy ipa with cryo hops](beer/hazyipa.htm), but diluted a bit to reduce ABV. First beer that I've fermented in a carboy. It's good, but the first dozen pints have a harshness to the bitterness -- the lupulin oil coats your throat. The first pint was literally yellow-green in color. Lesson: don't keg hop, do dryhopping in the secondary.
