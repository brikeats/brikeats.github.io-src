[whale's vagina ipa](beer/whalesvaginaipa.html) Served on draft at Healthlytix. Much darker that predicted, very murky-looking. Decent bitterness, still not as much hop smell as I'd like. Hop taste is overwhelmed by caramel flavor, doesn't come across as an IPA.

[hazy ipa with cryo hops](beer/hazyipa.htm) Very good, popular at Healthlytix, one of my best. Hop smell fades after a few weeks, but still has good hop flavor. I'd prefer it a bit sweeter/less attenuated.  

[obligatory pale ale](beer/obligatorypaleale.htm) Good, pretty similar to the cryo hazy. It's not very clear, possibly due to dryhop haze (this is only after the first few pints). The fruitiness of the yeast comes through, as does the dankness of the hops. Next time, I'd make it a bit more bitter, a bit lower OG and use twice the dry hops.
